#### Where are the channels on Discord?
The channels are on the left-hand side under the *INTERSECT* category. The *stage* voice channel is only accessible to speakers. The *dialogue* voice channel is accessible by anyone. Anyone can create additional channels under the *INTERSECT* category. Voice channels have a loudspeaker icon and display participants in them.

#### Where can I find the assembly in the remote chaos experience?
This year the rc3 is not hosting a centralized event, so you can find us on [bonfire.link](https://bonfire.link) Discord server.
