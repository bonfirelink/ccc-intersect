Noise and signal get easily muddled in digital space. Hand signals can be used to keep communication clear and to prune unnecessary conversation. Use them to help everyone be heard, rescue someone from going to deep into a rabbit hole or redirect discussions when they go off-topic. We all share the responsibility to keep healthy dialogue in self-organized rooms!
