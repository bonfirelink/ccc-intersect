title: INTERSECT at Chaos Communication Congress
subtitle: 30th December 2021
---

INTERSECT is an intentional assembly, an ancient tradition, a crossroads where humans stop and gather to reflect before continuing their journey in life. It is said that these humans come to INTERSECT moved by a desire to hack their worldviews and challenge their most cherished beliefs. It is also said that they leave from INTERSECT transformed from each other's perspectives and walking towards shared futures worth materializing. Rumour has it that in the present they conspire to make those futures past, as they harness the power of technology and religion. They cometh not alone. Join them in this exercise of speculative realism at CCC.

Wait, but what's going on?<br/>

> #### Chaos Communication Congress
> The Internet is an interconnected physical structure

The [Chaos Communication Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_Communication_Congress) is an annual hacker conference and festival. During four days between Christmas and New Yearâ€™s Eve, around 20 thousand hackers, technology freaks, artists, and utopians get together to communicate, learn from each other, and party together. CCC focuses on a wide range of topics related to digital security and privacy: civil disobedience, climate change, art, human relations, open hardware, social change and more; in a nutshell, it aims to foster creative, skeptical discourse on the interaction between technology and society.

The event is entirely volunteer-driven, guided by an ethos that builds on DIY and hackerspace culture. Every participant is invited to share their knowledge and interests, learn from others, propose activities, work on projects, and in general contribute to the experience of the Congress.

This year's CCC is not organized centrally, but let's still make it a decentralized a chaos experience with remote events like Intersect.

> #### Assemblies
> Here come the engines of Chaos

A fundamental unit of organisation of CCC is the assembly: a group of people sharing ideas or a common project. Assemblies are usually allocated a physical space, where people can hang out, hold discussions, self-organise workshops, lectures and other activities. There are dozens. INTERSECT is one more.

The contribution of INTERSECT to the Congress is a series of talks, conversations, workshops as well as live music shows. The assembly explores bottom-up collaboration, community-building and the narratives that make communities coherent. It also explores modern tools for cooperation, such as decentralized infrastructure and cryptoeconomics, as well as ancient ones, such as mysticism and the dialectic method, i.e. cooperative argumentative dialogue. The ultimate vision is to create a serious playground for weaving stories of possible futures in times of apocalypse.
