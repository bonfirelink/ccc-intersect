subtitle: A game of artful participation where no one and everyone is the author.

This type of session has no agenda and takes place in multiple channels simultaneously. It's coordinated by participants abiding by the "law of two feet". Go wherever you feel like going! If you feel lost, perhaps you might seek somebody. If you can't find a space, create one!

**Purpose.** Creating safe spaces for human connection and exploration. Getting to know each other. Meeting old and new friends. Sparking curiosity. Questioning. Exploring.

**Open themes.** The topics are non-prescribed. Anyone can get involved in ways of their own choosing. This is a participatory meeting of hands, heads, and hearts in an open space to build collective capacity, embrace diversity, and manifest our resonant potential. Play the way you feel it!

**Dynamic channels.** Gather in small groups based on shared purpose and interest. Channels can easily be created on Discord. As conversations drift and topics change, rename them by right-clicking and selecting "Edit Channel". This is a very easy way to signal to others what is going on.

**Format guided by [open space principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology):**
- Whoever comes is the right people.
- Whatever happens is the only thing that could have.
- When it starts it's the right time.
- When it’s over it’s over.
