The regime of xenogaming is an integrative framework of post-economic productive activity which weds pervasive gamification and immersive lifestyle RPG storytelling with efficacious social impact in ‚Äúthe real world‚Äù. Xenoreaction, the result of meme-splicing the most corrosive and ferocious strains of ultra-far-left and ultra-far-right ‚Äúactivism‚Äù, presents a coherent methodology for systematically welding movements together in supreme acts of preemptive counterviolence.

In this workshop, we propose a grand unified theory of intra-community schism, and elucidate the relationship between individual and group trauma-load. Understanding how small acts of cowardice build into vicious wars to offload emotional labor informs a predictive cybernetic theory of conflict escalation. The cryptodynamics of unschism may reveal new maths that allow consensus ledgers to nullify and forget (or depotentiate) the painful past while remaining immutable.

Moritz (and perhaps a super secret surprise guest) will take you through an intellectual and mimetic tour de force. This casual interactive performance is a reinterpretation of the original debut at Refactor Camp 2019: Escaping Reality.
