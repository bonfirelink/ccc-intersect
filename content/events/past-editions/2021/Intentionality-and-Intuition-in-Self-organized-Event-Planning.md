Morta Kazlauskaite has been part of community based collectives since 2017, organizing events and experiences around the globe. Berlin based HedonÃ© (https://www.hedone.berlin) artist collective and Lithuanian Pretty Much Tribe (https://m.facebook.com/prettymuchtribe/ ) are the two organizations she has contributed to the most, creating intentional spaces designed intuitively. Morta will share some of these experiences and invite for a conversation around ideas and roles of intentionality and intuition in event planning, experience design and community building.
