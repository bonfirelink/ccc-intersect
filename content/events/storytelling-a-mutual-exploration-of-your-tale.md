Stories are beautiful creatures. They may be completely false and wonderful, painstakingly true and hurtful. Stories are able to create a whole new world, or help us to get to terms with the current one. We can use our stories to clarify where we come from or where we want to go. It's always a good idea to work on your stories. Let's explore them together in this distributed workshop. We'll be sharing in group work and you can take with you some more work I'll give you in the workshop, to engage with at your own time.
