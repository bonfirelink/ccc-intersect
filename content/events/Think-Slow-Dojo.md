The Think Slow Dojo is a space to practice Shared Thinking. Expect to approach questions from different perspectives in small groups of participatory reflection. With the help of facilitated structures youâ€™ll be offered a procedure to help you enact the virtue. Together weâ€™ll discover, invent and inspire fresh insights and, with luck, wisdom.
